## Overview and Origin

**Name of company**  
Douugh Ltd (ASX: DOU) 

**When was the company incorporated?**   
Douugh was founded in 2016. 

**Who are the founders of the company?**   
Andy Taylor is the founder of Douugh and is also the co-founder of SocietyOne, Australia's first and leading P2P Lending Platform. 

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**  
Quote from Douugh website *"We believe that existing banking and investing apps in the market are not designed to help educate and inspire to adopt the right money habits to build long-term wealth and achieve financial independence, which everyone inspires to achieve. We seek to change the paradigm by using technology that shifts the customer experience away from self-service to self-driving money management through automation."* [Douugh](https://douugh.com/about)

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**  
Douugh was funded with $2.5m of Seed capital in 2016 and 2017. On March 28th, 2022 there was a POST-IPO equity raise of $20m. Total of $22.5m raised in capital. 

## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**  
Douugh is on a mission to help Australians take control of their finances and adopt winning money habits to create long term wealth on autopilot. They are trying to do this by bringing together investing, banking, borrowing/personal lending and rewards by having the following options:
* Spend - This is a spending account linked to Mastercard. Their feature lets you "pay now" or "pay later". Digital card only providing environmental benefits and quick access to funding. 
* Spot - This is their "pay later" feature with two options:     
    * Option 1 Spot Advance - Borrow up to $500 on demand, deposited straight into the Spend account. Repay it in four weekly installments for a fixed $1.25 fee per repayment. 
    * Option 2 Auto-Spot - Pay for an item directly from the "Spot jar", instead of money being deposited into your "Spend" account and you being able to spend the money as you see fit, you can pay for an item directly and then repay the loaned capital in four weekly installments with a $1.25 fee per week. 	
* Stockback - This is a reward feature. The transaction on your spend card can earn interest and when $5 is reached Douugh will invest it into your selected investment profile automatically.
* Invest - Douugh provides different funds for you to choose to invest in depending on your risk tolerance (low, moderate, aggressive). You can also set it to auto invest an amount you select. They also allow you to invest in US companies and the funds are managed by Blackrock.  

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** 
Douugh's intended customer are everyday Australians predominantly millennials and gen-Z's who are driven to set themselves up for the future and build wealth. 
Founder and CEO, Andy Taylor, said *"many Aussies are currently feeling stressed about their finances thanks to the steep increase in interest rates to combat rising inflation. The Aussie dream of owning a home is now increasingly out of reach for Gen-Z and many Millennials, On top of this, we are seeing an increase in the use of revolving credit cards to help smooth their cash flow, which increases the likelihood of trapping many people into a spiraling debt cycle due to compounding interest on outstanding balances.‚Äù*  [Reference](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02676277-6A1154147?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?**  
Douugh is offering the world's first Pay Now or Pay Later Stockback rewards Mastercard, which as mentioned before allows you to earn interest on your transaction which will be invested in the stock-market via Douugh's portfolios. Douugh are trying to provide a one stop shop where you can bank, invest, borrow and earn rewards all in the one spot. Therefor limiting the need for Afterpay, Paypal, Commsec, Robinhood, Frequent flyers, Flybys, ING, ANZ, etc. 

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**  
Distribution through Merchants - Online merchants will be able to offer their customers Douugh's Stockback reward program, with the option of Pay Now or Pay Later features already integrated to make to checkout experience seamless. Douugh will handle the settlements with the merchant and customers. Stockback rewards to be funded by the merchant and Douugh charging a processing fee of 2% to the merchant. This is a proprietary PNPL stockback service to help increase sales and foster greater customer loyalty. This product is due to launch in Q2FY24. 

## Landscape:

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**  
The advantage Douugh are offering is combining a few domains into one but ultimately they would be classed in the Neo-banking domain as they are an online bank. The other domains that Douugh are bringing together are the personal online banking domain with their Spend account, lending domain with the Spot buy now pay later option and mastercard rewards system, Robo-adviser domain and capital management domain with Douugh's auto-invest into Blackrocks funds or the option of buying single stocks.   

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**    
There is another domain called challenger banking. After the GFC (global financial cris) there were new startup banking businesses forming that challenged the traditional large banks, hence the domain challenger banking. Neobanking came about around the year 2016 with banks operating exclusively online. 
A major trend within the lending Domain over the last 5-10 years was the innovation of Afterpay, who started the buy now pay later trend, and Zip Co. following suit. Since the F.I.R.E (Financial Independence, Retire Early) community came to light around 1992 (which could be credited to the best selling book, "Your money or your life" by Vicky Robin), there has been a surge for investors to start investing early. As a result, there have been a lot of trading apps developed like eToro, CMC Markets, Commsec Pocket and IG Trading. More recently companies have been developing Robo-advisers to make investing easier for the inexperienced investors with micro-investing or developed diversified funds to invest in. Some of these companies are SoFi Automated investing, Spaceship voyager, Sharesies, Pearler and Six Park. 

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**   
Other major neobank companies are Tyro Payments (Business Banking), Judo Bank, Up Bank, Alex Bank, BNK and Easy Street Financial Services. The closest company I can find to Douugh is Betterment as it has a checking account, auto-investing and mastercard rewards system. Betterment does not have an app though. 

## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**  
Douugh is still working towards releasing their Spend, Spot and Stockback products which are set to go live in Q4 FY23 so the only revenue they have is from their current customers on the trading platform, which came from Goodments when they bought them out in Jan, 2021.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**  
Some core metrics that I have pulled from Douugh's quarterly statement are:  
* Number of customers - Douugh currently has 7,000 registered customers and 1,300 active customers.
* Total revenue - Q3 22-23 Douughs revenue stood at $22,848, up 475% from Q2.
* Average funding per month - per customer was $232.
* Average annualized revenue per users - currently $112.  

Key metrics to compare ASX listed companies for yr 22 would be: 
* Annual sales - Douughs annual sales was $588,364.
* Total comprehensive income loss for the year - -$13,487,518.
* Return on equity - -313.50% for 2022.
* Market capitalization - $12m.
* Total return as percentage compare to the previous year - -85%.  

As you can see Douugh's metrics are pretty poor at the moment and I would not invest in this company as it stands right now, although I can see the appeal for customers wanting a one stop shop for investing, banking, afterpay and rewards. It will be interesting so see how they perform in the future when all products are running. 


**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**  
Douugh has not yet officially launched their full range of products, so it is hard to compare it to its competitors. I will compare them to Raiz, which is an investing platform operating in Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia. From Raiz's FY22 report they report activate customers amounting to 660,624. Funds under management $1.01B AUD. Revenue per customer $55.9 AUD. Revenue for FY22 was $18,695,000. Total comprehensive income loss for the year was -$11,249,000. As you can see Raiz has a lot more customers and is generating a lot more revenue. What is interesting though is Raiz is still operating at a loss and it has been operating in Australia since 2016. Funds Under Management has gone from $43m in 2016 to $996m in 2022, which is impressive. 

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**  
I think a really good product to add to the Douugh offering would be an investing for kids option. If Douugh had an option where you could create a separate account for your kids so you could start investing for them, that would work well with their vision of building long term wealth and financial freedom. 

Another option I think Douugh should incorporate with their Spend account feature is an AI budgeting tool that shows you where all your money is going. Examples would be expenses categorised by merchants, then also by category like clothes, food, fuel, etc. Also a feature showing you how much you're saving, spending and investing. 

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**  
I think the kids investing option would be great as it leverages Douugh's vision by setting you up for the future. I'm sure a lot a parents that are interested in investing want to help their kids out, hence why other companies are offering this service as well. 

I believe a lot of Australian's don't know budgeting basics and a lot of people are living pay check to pay check. If Douugh could help their customers see how they are using their money, where it is going and how they can improve, this would be a great benefit. 

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**  
Robotic process automation and artificial intelligence. 

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**  
Robotic process automation is appropriate for the kids investing product. If a customer wants to create an account for their child then it would be like filling out a form and creating an account which could be all automated and the account to be set up very quickly with all data verified on the spot. 

Artificial intelligence would be appropriate for the budgeting product as you could use algorithms and machine learning to analyse customers accounts and produce the results needed, like  spending habits, merchants, etc.
